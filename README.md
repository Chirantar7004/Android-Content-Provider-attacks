# Content-Providers
Content Providers are methods of sharing data. Content providers are primarily used for searching the data within application and using widgets on top of application data. Both structured data such as SQLlite db and unstructured data such as image files can be be saved using content provider. In addition, they offer a granular control over accessing their data. More on it [here](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/content-providers).
